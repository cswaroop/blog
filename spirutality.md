# Spirutality

* Stillness and being in present (supremely conscious in chaos)

* Yoga
  - connecting mind, body and spirit
  - creating localized energy at every part of your body
  - control on the body as precursor to develop higher conscious mind

* Human consciousness degradation over time and suffering it caused to humanity often accompanied by religion, communism, race etc.

* Ego
  - From where does it derive its existance?  What why we automatically identify ourself with his our own created imaginary self

* Purpose of Life beyond getting wealthy, healthy, binge helping(instant gratification by leaving  coins to beggers at traffic jams)

## Eckhart Tolle

 
god communicates with everyone.

God doesn't communicate with words.

Its with `feelings`.
Also communicate with `thoughts`. - images
Then `words`.
