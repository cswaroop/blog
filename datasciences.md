* Data access (access to Hadoop data as well as basic ETL)
* Data preparation and exploration (binning, feature selection and custom mappings)
* six predictive analytics techniques: linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural nets, time series analysis, support vector machine (SVM) and ensemble models
* five descriptive analytics techniques: k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, analysis of variance (ANOVA), link analysis and principal component analysis (PCA)
* Model testing and validation, such as k-fold cross-validation and return on capital (ROC) curve (lift curve with some action/strategy consideration)
* Model deployment: Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) support and R-integration/export
